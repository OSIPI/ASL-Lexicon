# TF4.1_ASL_Lexicon

## Overview 

On behalf of the ISMRM Perfusion Study Group, and as part of the ISMRM Open Science Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI), the ASL Lexicon Task Force (TF4.1) has been working on the development of　an ‘ASL Lexicon and Reporting Recommendations’ for perfusion imaging and analysis, aiming to 1)　develop standardized, consensus nomenclature and terminology for the broad range of ASL imaging　techniques and parameters, as well as for the physiological constants required for quantitative analysis,　and 2) provide a community-endorsed recommendation of the imaging parameters that we encourage　authors to include when describing ASL methods in scientific reports/articles.
